sdesc: "ROX terminal emulator"
ldesc: "ROXTerm is a terminal emulator intended to provide similar 
features to gnome-terminal, based on the same VTE library, but with a 
smaller footprint and quicker start-up time. It achieves this by not 
using the Gnome libraries and by using a separate applet to provide the 
configuration GUI. It can be used as a ROX application, as the name 
implies, or in any other X environment."
